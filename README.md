# Tegas

Tegas is a testing framework for C, written in C. It supports unit testing and functional/output testing.

Tegas is intended to be small, precise and easy to use.

The source file should be a single file or just a binary, where installation can be made in less than 3 steps.

Using Tegas should also be even easier, where tests are written in .test.c file and running all tests for the whole directory is as simple as running a single command.
